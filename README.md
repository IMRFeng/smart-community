# smart-community

We realise that to form a whole picture of your local community, searching and analysing information can be overwhelming and frustrating. 
The smart community is a cloud-based solution that gathers local information from the community from multiple reliable resources such as a government database and other authorised parties. 
For example, Simon's family lives in Devonport, his son is going to apply for a high school this year but he has no idea about the local high schools. He happens to have a local community app, he calls his community assistant called "Mirror Mirror".
